Base in our observation and as we checked the system unit, we found out that the fuse of the power supply was defective. This is the main reason why we did not check the other parts of the system unit if it is also defective. We also observed that the system unit is not maintained well, the system unit itself id=s dusty as well as the parts inside, the wires are weak or can be easily tear down, and it can really affect the system unit.
So, I recommend that we should clean the system unit carefully because as we all know, system unit and its parts is vey fragile. Replacing the fuse and the other parts that are replaceable is highly recommended or if its not already functioning well but well-maintained, the best move is to buy a new one.
